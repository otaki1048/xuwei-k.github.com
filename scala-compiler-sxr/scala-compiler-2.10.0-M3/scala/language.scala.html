   *  their definition falls out quite naturally from Scala’s concept of type refinement.

  /** Only where enabled, definitions of implicit conversions are allowed. An

   *     implicit val conv = (s: String) =&gt; s.length
   *     implicit def listToX(xs: List[T])(implicit f: T =&gt; X): X = …

   *  implicit values of other types are not affected, and neither are implicit
   *  classes.
   *
   *  _Why keep the feature?_ Implicit conversions are central to many aspects
   *  of Scala’s core libraries.
   *
   *  _Why control it?_ Implicit conversions are known to cause many pitfalls
   *  if over-used. And there is a tendency to over-use them because they look
   *  very powerful and their effects seem to be easy to understand. Also, in
   *  most situations using implicit parameters leads to a better design than
   *  implicit conversions.

  /** Only where this flag is enabled, higher-kinded types can be written.
   *
   *  _Why keep the feature?_ Higher-kinded types enable the definition of very general
   *  abstractions such as functor, monad, or arrow. A significant set of advanced
   *  libraries relies on them. Higher-kinded types are also at the core of the
   *  scala-virtualized effort to produce high-performance parallel DSLs through staging.
   *
   *  _Why control it?_ Higher kinded types in Scala lead to a Turing-complete
   *  type system, where compiler termination is no longer guaranteed. They tend
   *  to be useful mostly for type-level computation and for highly generic design
   *  patterns. The level of abstraction implied by these design patterns is often
   *  a barrier to understanding for newcomers to a Scala codebase. Some syntactic
   *  aspects of higher-kinded types are hard to understand for the uninitiated and
   *  type inference is less effective for them than for normal types. Because we are
   *  not completely happy with them yet, it is possible that some aspects of
   *  higher-kinded types will change in future versions of Scala. So an explicit
   *  enabling also serves as a warning that code involving higher-kinded types
   *  might have to be slightly revised in the future.

  /** Only where enabled, existential types that cannot be expressed as wildcard

   *
   *  _Why keep the feature?_ Existential types are needed to make sense of Java’s wildcard
   *  types and raw types and the erased types of run-time values.
   * 
   *  Why control it? Having complex existential types in a code base usually makes
   *  application code very brittle, with a tendency to produce type errors with
   *  obscure error messages. Therefore, going overboard with existential types
   *  is generally perceived not to be a good idea. Also, complicated existential types
   *  might be no longer supported in a future simplification of the language.
