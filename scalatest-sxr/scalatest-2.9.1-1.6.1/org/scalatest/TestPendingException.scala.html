 * Exception thrown to indicate a test is pending.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A &lt;em&gt;pending test&lt;/em&gt; is one that has been given a name but is not yet implemented. The purpose of
 * pending tests is to facilitate a style of testing in which documentation of behavior is sketched
 * out before tests are written to verify that behavior (and often, the before the behavior of
 * the system being tested is itself implemented). Such sketches form a kind of specification of
 * what tests and functionality to implement later.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * To support this style of testing, a test can be given a name that specifies one
 * bit of behavior required by the system being tested. The test can also include some code that
 * sends more information about the behavior to the reporter when the tests run. At the end of the test,
 * it can call method &lt;code&gt;pending&lt;/code&gt;, which will cause it to complete abruptly with &lt;code&gt;TestPendingException&lt;/code&gt;.
 * Because tests in ScalaTest can be designated as pending with &lt;code&gt;TestPendingException&lt;/code&gt;, both the test name and any information
 * sent to the reporter when running the test can appear in the report of a test run. (In other words,
 * the code of a pending test is executed just like any other test.) However, because the test completes abruptly
 * with &lt;code&gt;TestPendingException&lt;/code&gt;, the test will be reported as pending, to indicate
 * the actual test, and possibly the functionality, has not yet been implemented.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
